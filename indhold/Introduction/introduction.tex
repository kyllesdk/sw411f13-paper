\section{Introduction}
When writing a program for the first time, most programming languages can seem unintuitive and can be hard to understand. Beginners can make crucial mistakes and might have a hard time learning how to program without a teacher to instruct them.\\

Programming languages differ in various aspects and some are more intuitive for beginners than others. Some languages are complex, which often is due to the fact that they have a lot of features. For a beginner, the complexity of having several different methods to produce the same outcome, is obsolete and can make a language difficult to learn. \\

When programming for the first time, a programmer can choose to start with any language. A beginner with interest in learning about smaller hardware is likely to encounter the programming language of Arduino. Arduino gives programmers the option to program components and use them for a wide variety of purposes. Since Arduino is a small board with just one processor for input and output, the options are relatively few and it is easy to get an overview. However the programmer can also attach other boards to the Arduino, which will add to the complexity of what the programmers has to understand in order to achieve the desired outcome. \\
