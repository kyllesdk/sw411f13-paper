\section{Introduction}
When writing a program for the first time, most programming languages can seem unintuitive and be difficult to understand. This can make it difficult to learn for people without any to little programming experience, especially if they are not assisted by a teacher.\\

Programming languages differ in various aspects and some are more intuitive for beginners than others. Some languages are complex, which often is due to the fact that they have a lot of features. The complexity of having several different methods to produce the same outcome, this can be confusing and make a language difficult to learn. \\

A beginner in programming with interest in learning about simple electronics is likely to encounter the programming language of Arduino. Arduino gives programmers the option to program components and use them for a wide variety of purposes. Since Arduino is a small board with just one processor for input and output, the options are relatively few and it is easy to get an overview. \\
