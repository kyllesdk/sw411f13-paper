\section{Translator}
For a programmer to avoid using the complicated Arduino language when programming for Arduino, there are two prerequisites. It requires another language, which the programmer can use to write the desired code. In order to get the code of the new langauge to work on Arduino, a translator is required. This makes the creation of a new language for Arduino a two step process. Without well-defined translations into the Arduino language, the new language cannot be executed on Arduino. Therefore a translator has to be created alongside the language.

\section{Compiler}
A compiler is a program that can take a source language as an input, and generate a target language as the output. The source and target language is defined by the design of the the compiler. The compiler will be further explained in chapter \ref{chap:the_compiler} 

\section{The project}
In this project a new programming language and compiler will be defined and created. The purpose of the new language is to simplify the proces of programming for Arduino. In order to make the code from the new language executable on Arduino it has to be translated into the Arduino language. The translation process will be handled by the compiler.
