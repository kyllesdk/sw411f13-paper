\section{Compiler}
If a programmer should be able to avoid using Wiring when coding for the Arduino it requires two things. First of all it obviously requires another language in which the programmer can write the desired code. For this code to function on the Arduino a translator is however also required. This makes the creation of a new language a two step progress, as it is not enough to design a language. Without very well-defined translations into another known language, the invented language literally has no meaning. Therefore a translator has to be created alongside with the language. This is called a compiler and can actually be quite complex. This is described in depth in chapter \ref{the_compiler}. The goal for this compiler is to be able to translate any code in the invented language into Wiring.
