\section{Compiler}
If a programmer should be able to avoid using the Arduino language when coding the Arduino, it requires two things. First of all it obviously requires another language, which the programmer can use to write the desired code. For this code to work on Arduino a translator is however also required. This makes the creation of a new language a two step process, as it is not enough to design a language. Without very well-defined translations into another known language, the invented language literally has no meaning. Therefore a translator has to be created alongside with the language. This is called a compiler and can actually be quite complex. This is described in depth in chapter \ref{the_compiler}. The goal for this compiler is to be able to translate any code in the invented language into the Arduino language.
