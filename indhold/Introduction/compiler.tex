\section{Translator}
For a programmer to avoid using the complicated Arduino language when programming for Arduino, there are two prerequisites. It requires another language, which the programmer can use to write the desired code. In order to get the code of the new langauge to work on Arduino, a translator is required. This makes the creation of a new language for Arduino a two step process. Without well-defined translations into the Arduino language, the new language cannot be executed on Arduino. Therefore a translator has to be created alongside the language.
