\section{Motivation for this project}\label{introduction:motivation}
When writing programs to the Arduino, one will stumble across the already existing Arduino language. The existing language is based on Wiring and looks a lot like C and C++. For one who is new in the field of programming it might be hard to learn. In this project a new language, which is easier to learn,\todo{Må vi godt påstå at vores sprog er lettere at lære end det foregående?} will be developed. The language will support features like simple mathematics and will also be able to print to an LCD display. In chapter \ref{analysis:source-language} the requirements and features of the new language can be read.

%Compilers are essential when making a programming language. Without the compiler the language would not be able to be build for the computer to use. Compiler gives the oppotunity for the programmer to program a language that can be compiled to another language
