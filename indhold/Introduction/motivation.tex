\section{Motivation}\label{introduction:motivation}
The Arduino language is based on C and C++, which are languages that can be seen as cryptic and unintuitive to newly started programmers. An example of C not being intuitive is when creating an array to hold 3 elements, and the array has to be set to a size that can hold 4 elements. This is needed because there is a special sign to mark the end of an array (zerobit), which takes a slot itself. The programmer can work around it and/or create the functionality, but to the inexperienced programmer it adds complexity. Without prior experience with programming, C and C++ can be difficult languages to learn. \\
For beginners it could be better if the Arduino language, was simpler and easier to understand. Since is built upon C and C++, and therefore has similar flaws, at least from a beginners perspective. This project will look into giving beginners an alternative to the Arduino language by creating a new language along with a compiler. This language will attempt to achieve user-friendliness with beginners in mind.
