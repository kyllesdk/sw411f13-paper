\section{Motivation for this project}\label{introduction:motivation}
When writing programs to the Arduino, one will find that the already existing Arduino language, which is based on Wiring language, can be hard to learn. Especially if you are new in the field of programming this can be hard to learn. In this project a new language, which is easier to learn, will be developed. The language will support features like simple mathemathics and will also be able to print to an LCD display. In chapter \ref{analysis:source-language} the requirements and features of the new language can be read.

%Compilers are essential when making a programming language. Without the compiler the language would not be able to be build for the computer to use. Compiler gives the oppotunity for the programmer to program a language that can be compiled to another language
