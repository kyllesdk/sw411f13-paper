\section{Improvement}\label{discussion:improvements}
By comparing the finished project with the MoSCoW analysis, every feature within the category ''must have`` has been achieved with the exception of the ability to define functions. Additionally, PH could be improved by adding more data types, and more functionality.\\

An important improvement for the compiler, is the ability to compile directly from PH to machine code, without the need of an external Arduino language compiler. This is because the task of compiling from PH to machine code would be a lot simpler.\\

The language does not currently take reserved words in the Arduino language into consideration, which should be solved because these words will result in errors when compiling the Arduino language to machine code. \\
