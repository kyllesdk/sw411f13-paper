\section{Improvement}\label{discussion:improvements}
In the current state of the programming language there are several aspects to still be improved on.

Comparing the finished project with the MoSCoW model described in \ref{analysis:moscow}, every feature within the category of must have has been achieved with the exception of functions (Including parameters and return values). Of the less important features, instantiation, the ability to print along with advanced operators has been implemented. We did however not get around to implement other loops than while, even though a foreach loop was desired. \\

The language does not currently respect reserved words in Arduino language which is something that should be solved as using these words will result in an error when compiling from Arduino to machine code. The language does not deal with the need for parenthesization in arithmetic expressions and leaves this job to the Arduino compiler. While this can be considered lazy, there is really no need to create this functionality redundantly. \\ \todo{Morten: Add alle jeres improvements. pls.}
