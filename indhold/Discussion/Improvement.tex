\section{Improvement}\label{discussion:improvements}
By comparing the finished project with the MoSCoW analysis, every feature within the category ''must have`` has been achieved with the exception of the ability to define functions. However the ability to call already existing functions is possible, which makes the programmer able to use the various Arduino libraries. Additionally, PH could be improved by adding more data types, and more functionality in form of control structures. \\

An important improvement for the compiler, is the ability to compile directly from PH to machine code, without the need of an external Arduino language compiler. This is because the task of compiling from PH to machine code would be a lot simpler.\\

The language does not currently take reserved words in the Arduino language into consideration, which should be solved because these words can result in errors when compiling the Arduino language to machine code. If the programmer declares a variable with the same name as a reserved word in the Arduino language it may create problems. \\
