\section{Compiler language}
The compiler is basically a program like any other. This also mean it is coded in a language as any other kind of software and the choice of programming language is a fundamental decision. Considering several programming languages, the one that stood out as the best choice ended up being Java. With cross-platform capability the entire project group are able to participate in coding, and even more important for our personal preferences it has the features of object orientation which is desired. Furthermore Java has some strong similarities to the languages C and C\#, both of which the entire group has some experience with. Also worth mentioning is that the language is generally used in this semester, leaving us the safety of being able to receive help if needed.
