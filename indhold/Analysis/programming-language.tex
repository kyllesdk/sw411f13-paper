\section{The chosen language}
In this project a new programming language is supposed to be made. The language is supposed to be used be people that are beginners in the field of programming. The programming language is a replacement for the already existing Arduino programming language.\todo{Jonas: Vi skal nok have et afsnit om arduino vi kan henvise til} 
The goal with the new language is that it should be easier to implement than the existing Arduino programming language. The syntax should be more readable. \todo{Jonas: Ydeligere specificering er nok n√∏dvendig}

The language should be compiled down to the Arduino language. The language will not be compiled to machine code. \\

The requirements for the language is listed below:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Very readable, also by users that are not familiar with programming languages.
	\item Easy to learn how to do basic programming in the language.
	\item Should be compiled down to Arduino.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Python}
