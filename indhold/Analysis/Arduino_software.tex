\section{The Arduino language}
The Arduino was created in Italy at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea in Italy, by Massimo Banzi and David Cuartielles. They where looking for an easy and cheap way for design students to integrate micro controllers in the projects\cite{arduino:hist}. Both the board and the programming language was based on the works of Hernando Barrag√°n, one of Massimo Banzi master thesis students \cite{Wiring:thesis}

\subsection{The language}
The language is based on wiring and therefore there are a lot of similarities between the to languages, but the Arduino team have added to, and improved the functions, and made it compatible with a wider range of chips. Also the language is implemented using C/C++ unlike wiring which is implemented using processing \cite{Wiring:thesis}.\\
To help facilitate the compatibility with a wide range of AVR chips, the Arduino language makes great use of AVR Libc \cite{AVR:lib}, which is an open source C library to that supply the necessary functionality to make it possible to use the Atmel AVR micro controllers.
