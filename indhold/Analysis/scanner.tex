\section{Scanner}
This section contains a description of the scanning phase of the compiler. It is the first phase of the compilation process. The scanner is part of the lexical analysis, and its purpose is to create a stream of tokens from the input. Each token corresponds to a terminal symbol of a programming language. The token stream is created by scanning the input, one character at a time.
