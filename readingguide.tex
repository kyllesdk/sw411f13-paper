\section{Reading guide}
Hi Radu, we are now ready for you to make the final corrections for the following parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Informal Specification (part 4) 
\item Syntax and Semantics (part 5), ending at page 22.
\end{itemize}

And we want to ask of you to review these parts from last time again, as they have been slightly reworked, the corrections that you might have made for last week might be able to be used still, however we changed some bits in it.
\begin{itemize}
\item The Compiler (part 3, chapter 2)
\item Source Language (part 3, chapter 3) - all the way until part 4 starts.
\end{itemize}

We haven't changed much in the rest of the report because we are working on the coding.
