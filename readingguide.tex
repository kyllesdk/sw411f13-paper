\textbf{Status:} We have startet implementing the compiler. We are soon done with the scanner which is the program that checks if the source-language has been written correctly.

Besides that we also have begun implementing the parser which is the part of the compiler that finds tokens and generates a parse tree, in this project a top-down parse tree.
