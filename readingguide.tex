\section{Reading guide}

\begin{itemize}
	\item We re-arranged the structure, can you check if it is okay?
	\item Semantics section \ref{sec:semantics}
\end{itemize}

Note: \textit{The semantics section will probably be revised after Friday, because we will learn about that particular part of semantics on Friday.}
