This report documents the problem of creating a simplified version of Arduino language along with a compiler to translate from this simplified version to Arduino. The report describes the process of completing this task, and takes into account how the product holds up against Arduino language. Both pre-analysis, actual implementation and testing of the invented language are described in detail. The report furthermore includes the theory needed to understand the steps taken. At the end of the report the product is evaluated and the choices reflected upon.
